### This is an example repo for how to add custom domains as a feature to a Phoenix app using Approximated.app

The example is a blog hosting platform, where we can choose to let some blogs connect a custom domain (or several).

To start the Phoenix server in development:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
